PDE is used to detect software design pattern in Java software. It is written in Java. 


= Prerequisites =

Note: In order to run PDE, the following things need to be installed
  * Static fact extraction: SWAG toolkit from the University of Waterloo. We make use of javex, grok and ql from the toolkit to extract static facts from the Java software that is analyzed. The toolkit can be downloaded [http://www.swag.uwaterloo.ca/swagkit/index.html here]. The user of PDE does not need any knowledge about javex, grok and ql. PDE will take care of executing the tools when needed.
  * Dynamic fact extraction: In order to extract dynamic facts from the Java software we use the TPTP Plugin for Eclipse, see [http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/ Eclipse Plugin TPTP]. We provide a probe for TPTP that will instrument the code so that the result is stored in a format the PDE is able to use. We will explain these steps in detail here, EclipseTPTP.
